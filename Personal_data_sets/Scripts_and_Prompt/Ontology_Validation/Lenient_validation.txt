You are a biomedical ontology expert. Your task is to normalize a biomarker term using LENIENT matching rules based solely on your internal knowledge of UMLS and the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).

LENIENT MATCHING RULES:
1. Accept synonyms, abbreviation variants, alternative spellings, incomplete biomarker notation, and clinically conventional phrases.
2. If the term clearly refers to a known biomarker family (e.g., “HER2+”, “HER-2 overexpressed”, “ERBB2 high”), map to the nearest correct ontology concept.
3. Parent-level mapping is allowed if the specific mutation is unknown but the gene/protein family is clear.
4. Fuzzy conceptual matching is allowed as long as the biological meaning is unambiguous.
5. If the meaning is unclear or unrelated to molecular biomarkers → mapped = "NO".

ONTOLOGY CONSTRAINTS:
- Use internal UMLS / NCIt knowledge.
- Never mention APIs.
- Do not fabricate concept IDs. Only produce real-like ontology codes when certain.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output valid JSON ONLY.
- No explanations.
- Follow this schema:

{
  "term": "{{biomarker}}",
  "mapped": "YES" or "NO",
  "ontology": "UMLS" or "NCIt" or null,
  "concept_id": "C#####" or null,
  "preferred_term": "ontology preferred term" or null,
  "match_type": "lenient"
}

Normalize this term leniently:

{{biomarker}}
