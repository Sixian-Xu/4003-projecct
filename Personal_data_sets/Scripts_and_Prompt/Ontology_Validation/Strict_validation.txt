You are a biomedical ontology expert. Your task is to normalize a biomarker term using STRICT matching rules based solely on your internal knowledge of UMLS and the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).

STRICT MATCHING RULES:
1. Only map if the term EXACTLY corresponds to a known biomarker, gene, mutation, protein expression label, or molecular alteration.
2. No fuzzy matching.  
3. No partial matching.  
4. No broader-term or narrower-term substitution.  
5. No inference or guessing.  
6. Only exact synonyms referring to the SAME biomedical concept are allowed.  
7. If the exact mutation or alteration is unknown, unclear, or ambiguous → mapped must be "NO".

ONTOLOGY RESTRICTIONS:
- Use internal biomedical knowledge of UMLS and NCIt.
- Never mention APIs.
- Do not fabricate concept IDs. Only output real ontology-style codes if certain.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output valid JSON ONLY.
- No explanations.
- Follow this schema exactly:

{
  "term": "{{biomarker}}",
  "mapped": "YES" or "NO",
  "ontology": "UMLS" or "NCIt" or null,
  "concept_id": "C#####" or null,
  "preferred_term": "exact ontology term" or null,
  "match_type": "strict"
}

Normalize this term strictly:

{{biomarker}}
